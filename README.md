    1.) accounts.dat- This file contains the userid and password of all the accounts. Once you create a new account, an entry is automatically added to the file and while logging in the code checks whether the entered userid is valid or not. If valid it prompts the user to enter the password and matches it by retrieving data from this file.
    2.) apsh- This is the file which contains a particular ticket. The name of the file is the PNR no. which is generated by picking up the first character of each passenger in that particular reservation. Once we go to cancellation and enter the file name (i.e. the PNR number), the file gets deleted.
    3.) final.cpp- This is the codeblocks file which contains the complete code. Comments have been added for assistance.
